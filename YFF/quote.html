      "Heroes and villains both thrive on violence, but we’re still categorized. “You’re good” “You’re evil”. That’s how it is! Symbol of peace? Hah! In the end you’re just a tool for violence, made to keep us down. And violence only breeds more violence- Tomura Shigaraki",
      "I would rather be a brainless monkey than a heartless monster– Goku",
      "I am looking at things from a much higher perspective than you. I observe this world, this universe, the truth of all things. And I have realized that mortals must be destroyed.

Yet ive had to watch you surpass me in strength, my destiny thrown to the wayside- Majin Vegeta",
      "Is that supposed to be insulting? You say im arrogant i say damn right. Thats pride. Pride in the saiyan i am. The mighty prince of the ultimate warrior race. Impossible to defeat you? Dont make me laugh. I wont surrender control, thats not the man i am. Let Kakarot use his thoughtless Ultra Instinct all he wants, but im the one whos gonna crush you Jiren, and im gonna do it my way. You claim im no threat to you, i assume that means you wont act like a coward and try to avoid this blast- Vegeta",
