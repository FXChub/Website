    <h2>Famous Landmarks</h2>
        <h2>Golden Gate Bridge</h2>
                <p>Next up is the Golden Gate Bridge. This is one of the most iconic landmarks in California, and the world. The bridge spans across the Golden Gate. The bridge connects the city of San Francisco to Marin County.</p>
                <p>Construction began January of 1933, but wasn't until April of '37. It finally opened in May of '37 after over 4 years of construction.</p>
                <p>It is about 2.7 km long and a width of around 27 meters, and its longest span being 1280 meters.</p>
                <p>It was designed by at that time a fairly unknown engineer named Joseph Strauss. He had made around 400 drawbridges at the time and was certain that the bridge would cost way less than the estimated 100 million usd (equivalent to about 2.9 billion today).</p>
                <p>Thought resistance was high from both the people around the bridge, large companies and even the army, it did eventually open to the public and was immediately put into use.</p>
                <p>Today the bridge is one of the first things people think about when hearing California. Its become an iconic symbol of the state. and it isnt hard to see why.</p>

    <h2>Hollywood Sign</h2>
            <p>The Hollywood sign is another iconic landmark in California. Located in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles, the sign originally read "Hollywoodland" and was created in 1923 as an advertisement for a real estate development.</p>
            <p>Over the years, the sign has undergone several changes and restorations. In 1949, the "land" portion was removed, leaving just "Hollywood." The sign has since become a symbol of the entertainment industry and the glamour of Hollywood.</p>
            <p>Today, the Hollywood sign is a popular tourist attraction, with many visitors hiking up to the sign for a closer look and panoramic views of Los Angeles. The sign is also frequently featured in movies, television shows, and photographs, further cementing its status as a cultural icon.</p>

    <h2>Alcatraz Island</h2>
            <p>Alcatraz Island, located in San Francisco Bay, is another famous landmark in California. The island is best known for its former federal prison, which operated from 1934 to 1963 and housed some of the most notorious criminals in American history, including Al Capone and Robert Stroud, the "Birdman of Alcatraz."</p>
            <p>Today, Alcatraz Island is a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors from around the world who come to explore the prison and learn about its history. The island also features beautiful gardens, tide pools, and stunning views of the San Francisco skyline.</p>
            <p>In addition to its historical significance, Alcatraz Island has also played a role in Native American activism. In 1969, a group of Native American activists occupied the island for 19 months to protest federal policies and advocate for indigenous rights. This event brought national attention to Native American issues and is remembered as a significant moment in the history of indigenous activism in the United States.</p>
